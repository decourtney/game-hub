Jurble Game Hub


This project is intended to serve as a central repo and hosting location for user-created game apps similar to Itch.io.
Although this application will provide the same services as Itch.io the ultimate purpose of this application is to encourage my 13yr old (and friends) to focus more effort into development. How?... Initially only select accounts will have the authority to upload and advertise their games (for a more controlled development environment while this project grows). So inturn I hope the idea of 'owning' this platform will encourage him (and friends) to focus more effort into development.

Itch.io offers a wide variety of services and resources to its users and content creators.
Every account has the ability to upload and download content (games, comics, tools, etc.)
In-depth profile customization
Content dashboard with account analytics
Community forums
Vlog (devlogs) for posting content/creator updates
Accounts have typical social media functions (liking, following, rating, comments)

1:
User logins
User roles
  - Base user can login, create comments, add reactions, create favorites library, follow users
